### Note : if css files of any page is not loading then check if
 - if any src if pointing to ``` ../../cdn-0.repairmymobile.in ``` then rename to ``` ../src ```
### Reason : a folder named ```../cdn-0.repairmymobile.in``` has been moved to current project named as ```src``` that was previously was one directory ahead named as ie ```../cdn-0.repairmymobile.in``` and now is in current working directory named as ```src```
